//finding the sum of all numbers in the array

//1. declare variable pinthouse
//var pinthouse = 0; pinthouse is what the variable add to the numbers in the array to get the total sum

//2. we are going to write a for loop 
//we go up by one
//we use i =1
//i < array.length;

//3. add the numbers in the array from pinthouse by cycling through them in the for loop

//4. console.log(pinthouse);

function pinthouse(total) {
	var pinthouse = 0;

	for (i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
	
		pinthouse += total[i];
	}
	console.log(pinthouse);
}
