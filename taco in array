1 declare a variable 
var = taco;
taco equals -1 because taco is a place holder to compare the numbers of array too

2  a for loop to loop through the indexes of the array 
we will call our variable i 
it will go up by 1
we know to stop counting up when there is no more numbers to count or in other words when the array has ended
so we get number of numbers inside the array by doing what?
getting the length of the array so we know how many times we are going to have to compare the numbers
so that we can get the largest number


3 we would compare 2 numbers at a time, and set the larger of the 2 numbers in a variable

4 console.log(taco);

function taco(num) {

var taco = -1;

for (i = 0; i < num.length; i++) {

			if (num[i] > largest)
			{
				largest = num[i];
			}
	
		}

		console.log(largest);


}

}
